Our **Analytics Tools** provide you 
with visualization and analysis of your messaging to provide you with 
high level insights on how to achieve more effective messaging with your

 with a contact enabling you to achieve better understanding of clients 
over time based on their replies and sent messages. 

 Generating **Reports** has been made a **Do It Yourself feature**.
 Simply select the Dates and the system will generate a messaging report
 that you can download as an Excel File. This makes reporting and 
auditing your messaging a breeze.
