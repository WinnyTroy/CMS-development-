**Firstly,** SMS provides you 
with a direct way to reach your clients wherever they are. Most people 
carry their mobile phones with them wherever they are and receive an 
instant notification when the SMS is delivered. It's no wonder that **90% of SMSes** are read **within 3 minutes** of being sent and that **99% of all SMSes are opened**. Compare this with email where only about 30% of emails are read. This makes SMS a **more effective** channel for deliverying time critical information quickly and reliably.

**Secondly,** SMS works across 
most mobile phones from feature phones to smartphones. In many 
developing countries the percentage of the adult population with a 
mobile phone is 90%+ compared with about 20% of people with access to a 
computer and even less who have steady internet access. Therefore, SMS 
is the **mainstream** channel that will enable you to reach the **maximum** number of users.
